# Conflict of Interest Examples for Each Quadrant

## Examples to Help Guide Decisions

### ‚úÖ Green Light: No Actual Conflict + No Appearance

**You should participate normally in these situations:**

**Voting Examples:**

- Voting on ENS protocol upgrades or technical improvements
- Voting on general DAO operational procedures
- Voting on your working group's budget and funding requests
- Voting on compensation structures for the upcoming term (since you don't know if you'll be re-elected)
- Voting on other working groups' activities

**Working Group Decision Examples:**

- Reviewing grant applications from teams you don't know
- Participating in budget planning for your working group
- Selecting service providers you have no connection to
- Making operational decisions about working group processes
- Evaluating proposals based purely on merit
- Drafting proposals for upcoming term compensation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow Light: No Actual Conflict + Mere Appearance

**You should prefer to recuse yourself - appearance matters as much as reality:**

**Voting Examples:**

- You previously worked at a company now seeking funding (but left years ago with no ongoing interest)
- You own NFTs from a project seeking ENS integration support
- You've publicly endorsed a project that's now seeking grants

**Working Group Decision Examples:**

- Your roommate's team applies for a grant (no financial connection, but personal relationship)
- You're active in a community that's requesting funding
- A former colleague is on a team seeking approval
- You have received publicity or material goods from the subject of a decision
- You've tweeted positively about a project now under review

**What to do:**

1. **First choice: Recuse yourself** - This is the cleanest approach
2. **If recusal would seriously harm the process** (e.g., leaving too few stewards to make decisions):
   - Publicly disclose the relationship in detail
   - Let your fellow stewards decide if you should participate
   - Accept their judgment without argument
3. **Remember**: Protecting trust is worth more than any single decision

### üö® Red Light: Actual Conflict + No Appearance

**You must recuse yourself AND disclose - these hidden conflicts are the most dangerous:**

**Voting Examples:**

- You're an unpaid advisor to a proposal (not publicly known)
- You own tokens/equity in a project that would benefit from a decision
- You're silently invested in a competing project that would benefit from a "no" vote
- A proposal would grant you personally tokens or delegations (not as part of standard steward compensation)

**Working Group Decision Examples:**

- Your spouse works for a company applying for a grant
- You have a handshake deal for future compensation with an applicant
- A grant recipient has promised to hire you after your steward term
- You're providing informal consulting to a service provider candidate
- You have undisclosed token allocations from a project seeking support

**What to do:** Immediately disclose the conflict to your working group and recuse yourself from all related discussions and decisions. Your fellow stewards will handle the matter and may select a stand-in if needed.

### üõë Full Stop: Actual Conflict + Mere Appearance

**Obviously recuse yourself - everyone can see the conflict:**

**Voting Examples:**

- Voting on current term compensation that affects you directly
- Voting on a proposal that would grant you tokens or delegations outside normal compensation
- Your company or project is seeking DAO funding
- Voting to retroactively increase current term compensation

**Working Group Decision Examples:**

- Your working group is reviewing your company's grant application
- You're listed as an advisor or team member on an application
- The applicant is your current employer or client
- You're evaluating a service provider you work for
- Your working group is deciding on immediate bonuses or token distributions

**What to do:** Recuse yourself from all discussions and decisions. Leave the room (physical or virtual) during deliberations. Your fellow stewards will document your recusal and handle the decision.

## Important Distinction: Proposals vs Votes

When a proposal might benefit you (like token distributions to stewards):

- **You CAN participate** in drafting and discussing the proposal
- **You SHOULD abstain** from the actual vote
- Let the broader delegate body decide without your influence on the outcome

## The Guiding Principle

**In governance, perception is reality.** If reasonable people could question your impartiality, you should recuse yourself. This isn't about your actual integrity - it's about maintaining the community's trust in the process.

## When in Doubt

If you're not sure which quadrant you're in:

1. Ask yourself: "Would I financially benefit, directly or indirectly?"
2. Ask yourself: "Would a reasonable person think I might benefit?"
3. **If either answer might be yes, prefer recusal**
4. When unsure, disclose to your working group stewards and discuss
5. Remember: It's better to recuse unnecessarily than to participate inappropriately

## The Recusal Process

When you need to recuse yourself:

1. **Announce it clearly** to your working group
2. **Step out completely** - don't try to influence the outcome
3. **Let others handle it** - trust your fellow stewards
4. **Document it publicly** - transparency builds trust
5. **Stay out until it's resolved** - don't check in or ask about progress

## Why This Matters

Every time you choose recusal over participation when there's an appearance of conflict, you:

- Strengthen the community's trust in governance
- Set an example for future stewards
- Protect the legitimacy of the decision
- Show that ENS governance operates at the highest ethical standards
