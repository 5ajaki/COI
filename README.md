A Resource Repository for Items Related to the ENS DAO Conflict of Interest pledge

## Overview

This repository contains resources for the ENS DAO Conflict of Interest framework, designed to help stewards navigate potential conflicts transparently and maintain community trust in governance decisions.

## Resources

- [**Conflict of Interest Pledge**](conflict-of-interest-pledge.md) - The core pledge that stewards can sign, outlining commitments to transparency and ethical decision-making
- [**Conflict of Interest Examples**](conflict-of-interest-examples.md) - Practical examples for each quadrant of the conflict framework to help guide real-world decisions

## About This Framework

The pledge and framework mirror the content originally posted on the ENS DAO Governance Forum:  
[My Conflict of Interest Pledge as an ENS DAO Steward](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/my-conflict-of-interest-pledge-as-an-ens-dao-steward/20959?u=5pence.eth)

This repository will be kept up to date based on any refinements or changes that emerge from the forum discussion and community feedback.
