# ENS DAO Steward Conflict of Interest Pledge

## Why This Matters

Trust is the foundation of decentralized governance. When stewards make decisions about funding and resources - whether in formal votes or working group deliberations - the community needs to know these decisions are made for the benefit of ENS, not personal gain. Even the appearance of self-dealing can damage the trust we've built together.

## The Simple Framework

We use a straightforward 2x2 matrix to guide our decisions and participation:

### Understanding Conflicts:

- **Actual Conflict**: You or your organization would directly benefit financially from a decision
- **Appearance of Conflict**: Others could reasonably think you might benefit, even if you won't

### Our Commitments:

**1. When there's NO actual conflict and NO appearance:**

- ‚úÖ Participate fully in all discussions, decisions, and votes
- Example: Voting on general protocol improvements, working group budgets, or future term compensation

**2. When there's NO actual conflict but SOME appearance:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prefer to recuse yourself** - appearance matters as much as reality
- If recusal would harm the working group's ability to function, disclose publicly and let fellow stewards decide
- Example: Reviewing funding for a project where you know the team socially
- Remember: When in doubt, recuse yourself

**3. When there's an ACTUAL conflict but NO obvious appearance:**

- üö® Must recuse yourself completely - hidden conflicts are the most dangerous
- Disclose the conflict even if others might not notice
- Example: Being a silent advisor to a grant applicant

**4. When there's an ACTUAL conflict AND an appearance:**

- üõë Must recuse yourself from all related decisions
- Publicly state your recusal and reason
- Example: Voting on immediate benefits to yourself or your company's funding

## Important Distinctions

### Working Group Budgets and Compensation

- Stewards **CAN** vote on their working group's budget and funding requests
- Stewards **CAN** vote on compensation for future terms (since re-election is uncertain)
- Stewards **SHOULD NOT** vote on current term compensation changes or immediate token distributions

### Proposals vs Votes

When a proposal might benefit you (like governance token distributions):

- You **CAN** participate in drafting and discussing the proposal
- You **SHOULD** abstain from the actual vote
- Let the broader delegate body decide without your influence

## Recusal Procedures

When recusing yourself from working group activities:

1. Announce your recusal to your working group stewards
2. Step completely out of discussions and decisions
3. Allow other stewards to select an appropriate stand-in if needed
4. Ensure public disclosure of the recusal
5. If multiple stewards must recuse, engage the broader steward body

## My Pledge as an ENS DAO Steward

I pledge to:

1. **Put ENS First**: Make decisions based on what's best for the ENS ecosystem, not personal gain

2. **Be Transparent**: Disclose any situation that could reasonably be seen as a conflict, even if I'm unsure

3. **Recuse When Needed**: Step back completely from any decision where I have a direct financial interest, including:

   - Abstaining from votes
   - Leaving working group discussions
   - Not influencing outcomes through any channels

4. **Prefer Recusal**: When there's an appearance of conflict, I'll choose recusal over participation whenever practical

5. **Encourage Others**: Support fellow stewards in identifying and managing their own conflicts

6. **Accept Feedback**: Listen openly if someone raises a concern about a potential conflict

7. **Follow Procedures**: Use proper recusal mechanisms to ensure decisions remain valid and trusted

## Scope of Application

This pledge applies to all steward activities including:

- Formal DAO votes
- Working group grant reviews
- Budget and funding allocations
- Service provider selections
- Any decision involving DAO resources

## Core Principle

In governance, appearance matters as much as reality. Even when intentions are pure, if others could reasonably question impartiality, choosing recusal protects the trust that makes decentralized governance possible.

## Remember

It's not just about following rules - it's about maintaining the trust that makes decentralized governance possible. When in doubt, choose transparency and recusal over participation.
